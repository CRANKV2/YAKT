- Fixed log path (Not being created).
- Enabled Power Efficient by default (In order to reduce power usage).
- Check if Android boot up is done to execute the tweak.
- Clean up (Removed unused variables).
- Removed Blkio tweak (Not a significant change).
- Removed watermark_scale_factor tweak (We disable watermark_boost_factor so watermark_scale_factor is useless to tweak).
- Enabled CRF by default (It can decrease system latency but may increase cpu usage).
